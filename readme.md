# Advent of Code 2023 Submissions

Each folder contains the code I used to make my submissions for the 2023 Advent of Code challenge. Each folder also includes a readme.txt file with the description of the prompt for that day. If I at least attempted both parts of the prompt for a given day, the readme should have the description for each part.

> ### ***AI NOTICE***
> This code was written with the assistance of GitHub Copilot and each code file should state this in a comment at the top. At times, Copilot may have spit out some creepy text that appears to be ripped directly from someone else's comments, despite protestations that the generated code isn't supposed to include anything like that. When that happens, I will include the generated comments at the top of the script file, for maximum transparency. Since GitHub (MSFT) ***ASSURES*** us that the generated text is completely clean and free of copywrite then there should be no issue publishing them publicly.
> I DO NOT CONDONE the unauthorized use of any data (text, image, etc) from any source for the training of "AI", LLM, image/video/audio generation or related algorithmic logic, regardless of proposed intent.
